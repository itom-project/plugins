"""Finite digital input task.

Demo script for acquiring a finite set of digital
values with a National Instruments DAQ device.

To test this script, the NI MAX (Measurement & Automation
Explorer) has been used to create simulated devices.

In this test, a simulated device NI PCI-6220 (Dev2) with 3x8 digital
inputs is used. These inputs are distributed over 3 ports
(ports0, ports1, ports2). Every port has 8 bit (line0-line7).

You can either record an entire port, such that the obtained
number is a bitmask of all lines in the port, or you record
selected lines only. Then, every line is acquired into a
different row of the obtained dataObject.

The channel configuration string for digital input tasks always
follows this pattern:

DeviceName/PortName

or

DeviceName/PortName/LineName

If an entire port is read, the data type is either uint8, uint16 or int32,
depending on the number of lines per port (usually uint8). If single lines
are read, each line is written to one row (usually to an uint8 dataObject, too).

Hint: It depends on the NI DAQ devices, if they allow
integrating different devices into the same measurement
task or not. Many devices do not allow this.
