"""Finite analog input task for single value acquisitions.

Demo script for acquiring exactly one analog value
per channel per acquire() command
with a National Instruments DAQ device.

To test this script, the NI MAX (Measurement & Automation
Explorer) has been used to create simulated devices.

In this test, a simulated device NI PCIe-6321 with 16 analog input (AI)
ports was created and named "Dev1".

The channel configuration string for analog input tasks always
follows this pattern:

DeviceName/PortName,ConfigMode,MinVoltage,MaxVoltage

where ConfigMode is an integer from this list
(see also argument terminalConfig from command
DAQmxCreateAIVoltageChan):

DAQmx_Val_Cfg_Default = 0,
DAQmx_Val_Diff = 1,
DAQmx_Val_RSE = 2,
DAQmx_Val_NRSE = 3,
DAQmx_Val_PseudoDiff = 4

Hint: It depends on the NI DAQ devices, if they allow
integrating different devices into the same measurement
task or not. Many devices do not allow this.
