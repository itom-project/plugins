Overview
========

.. pluginsummaryextended::
    :plugin: NI-DAQmx

This plugin has mainly be tested with simulated NI I/O devices under Windows (using the NI Measurement and
Automation Explorer software - NI MAX). Simulated tested devices were: NI PCIe-6321, NI PCI-6220, NI PCI-6111,
NI PCIe-6323 and NI PCI-6520.


Driver Installation
====================

In order to run the **NI-DAQmx** plugin in *itom*, the **NI-DAQmx** driver from National Instruments
has to be installed on the computer (considering the right bitness 32bit or 64bit).

Windows
--------

Download and install the latest NI-DAQmx driver from
https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/drivers/download.ni-daqmx.html#346240

The major part of this driver is usually installed under **C:/Program Files/National Instruments** and
**C:/Program Files (x86)/National Instruments**. Some important libraries are also copied to the
**C:/Windows/System32**, where they are found from the itom plugin.

If you choose a different installation folder but the defaulft, please set the **NIDAQMX_ROOT**
environment variable to the equivalent "C:/Program Files (x86)/National Instruments"
folder.

Please be aware that multiple driver versions exists, some of which lead to linker errors
during the build process. For the latest build the binary and header files at
**[NiDAQmx-Foleder]/Shared/ExternalCompilerSupport/C** are used.

If you also want to compile the plugin, make sure that you enable the option
**Applications Development Supports / ANSI C Support** in the installer. This can also be done
by modifying the installation using the tab **Program and Features** in the Windows Control Panel
(see https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z000000P9udSAC ).

The itom **niDAQmx** plugin has mainly been developed and tested using **NI-DAQmx 18.06.0**.


Linux
------

National Instruments has only a limited support for Linux operating systems, such that
the **NI-DAQmx** driver is only available as RPM-package for Red Hat, SUSE and CentOS.

See this knowledge base entry (https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z00000159XISAY)
and see the links, where to download the linux driver and how to install it.


Initialization
==============

The plugin is initialized with a set of mandatory and optional parameters:

    .. plugininitparams::
        :plugin: NI-DAQmx

If the **taskName** is not given or an empty string, a default task name is given. All
parameters can be changed during the runtime of the instance, besides the major **task type**
and **task mode**. That means, that every instance of this plugin can be operated with one of the
following combinations (of course multiple instances can be run in parallel):

* Analog input task with a finite number of acquired samples (per run)
* Analog input task with continuous acquisition (from start to stop signal)
* Analog output task with a finite number of written samples (per run)
* Analog output task with continuous write (from start to stop signal)
* Digital input task with a finite number of acquired samples (per run)
* Digital input task with continuous acquisition (from start to stop signal)
* Digital output task with a finite number of written samples (per run)
* Digital output task with continuous write (from start to stop signal)

All analog tasks are created as voltage tasks, only. Transforming voltages into other physical units
must be done within the script.

It is not possible to combine analog and digital ports within one task, hence, once instance
of the plugin. Finite input tasks can also have a **reference trigger**, that is usually used
to stop the acquisition upon a certain input trigger. If this **refTriggerMode** is set, the
finite task behaves like a continuous task (see examples below) and acquires data from the start
signal until all conditions of the reference trigger are fulfilled.


Parameters
==========

These parameters are available and can be used to configure the **NI-DAQmx** instance.
During the runtime of an instance, the values of these parameters are obtained by the method *getParam*,
writeable parameters can be changed using *setParam*.

**availableDevices**: {str}, read-only
    comma-separated list of all detected and available devices
**availableTerminals**: {str}, read-only
    comma-separated list of all detected and available terminals (e.g. for
    'sampleClockSource' or 'startTriggerSource'). The standard sample clock source
    'OnboardClock' is not contained in this list.
**bufferSize**: {int}
    Sets and changes the automatic input / output buffer allocation mode. If -1 (default),
    the automatic allocation is enabled. Else defines the number of samples the buffer can
    hold for each channel (only recommended for continuous acquisition). In automatic mode
    and continuous acquisition, the standard is a buffer size of 1 kS for a sampling rate
    < 100 S/s, 10 kS for 100-10000 S/s, 100 kS for 10-1000 kS/s and 1 MS else. For input
    tasks, this size changes the input buffer size of the device, else the output buffer
    size.
**channels**: {str}
    semicolon-separated list of all channels that should be part of this task. Every item is
    a comma separated string that defines and parameterizes every channel.
**loggingActive**: {int}, read-only
    Indicates if TDMS file logging has been enabled and which mode was accepted by the
    device. The value has the same meaning than 'loggingMode'.
**loggingFilePath**: {str}
    The path to the TDMS file to which you want to log data.
**loggingGroupName**: {str}
    The name of the group to create within the TDMS file for data from this task. If empty,
    the task name is taken. If data is appended to a TDMS file, a number symbol (e.g. Task
    #1, Task #2...) is added at each run.
**loggingMode**: {int}
    0: logging is disabled (default), 1: logging is enabled with disabled read (fast, but no
    data can simultaneously read via getVal/copyVal), 2: logging is enabled with allowed
    reading of data.
**loggingOperation**: {str}
    Specifies how to open the TDMS file. 'open': Always appends data to an existing TDMS
    file. If it does not exist yet, the task start operation will return with an error;
    'openOrCreate': Creates a new TDMS file or appends data to the existing
    one;'createOrReplace' (default): Creates a new TDMS file or replaces an existing one;
    'create': Newly creates the TDMS file. If it already exists a task start operation will
    return with an error.
**name**: {str}, read-only
    NI-DAQmx
**readTimeout**: {float}
    Timeout when reading up to 'samplesPerChannel' values (per channel) in seconds. If -1.0
    (default), the timeout is set to infinity (recommended for finite tasks). If 0.0,
    getVal/copyVal will return all values which have been recorded up to this call.
**refTriggerLevel**: {float}
    Only for 'refTriggerMode' == 'analogEdge': The threshold at which to stop acquiring
    samples. Specify this value in the units of the measurement or generation.
**refTriggerMode**: {str}
    A reference trigger can be enabled to stop an acquisition when the device acquired all
    pre-trigger samples, an analog or digital signal reaches a specified level and and the
    device acquired all post-trigger samples. 'off': no reference trigger, 'digitalEdge':
    The trigger event is given if 'refTriggerSource' is activated (based on
    'refTriggerRisingEdge'), 'analogEdge': similar to 'digitalEdge', but the analog input
    'refTriggerSource' has to pass the value 'refTriggerLevel'. A reference trigger can only
    be set for finite, input tasks. The reference trigger can only be enabled for finite
    input tasks. However these tasks then behave like continuous tasks, but the stop command
    is automatically generated by the reference trigger event (plus additional post trigger
    values)
**refTriggerPreTriggerSamples**: {int}
    The minimum number of samples per channel to acquire before recognizing the Reference
    Trigger. The number of posttrigger samples per channel is equal to 'samplesPerChannel'
    minus this value.
**refTriggerRisingEdge**: {int}
    Specifies on which slope of the signal to stop acquiring samples. 1: rising edge
    (default), 0: falling edge.
**refTriggerSource**: {str}
    The source terminal of the trigger source (if 'refTriggerMode' is set to 'digitalEdge'
    or 'analogEdge').
**sampleClockRisingEdge**: {int}
    If 1, samples are acquired on a rising edge of the sample clock (default), else they are
    acquired on a falling edge.
**sampleClockSource**: {str}
    The source terminal of the Sample Clock. To use the internal clock of the device, use an
    empty string or 'OnboardClock' (default). An example for an external clock source is
    'PFI0' or PFI1'.
**samplesPerChannel**: {int}
    The number of samples to acquire or generate for each channel in the task (if taskMode
    is 'finite'). If taskMode is 'continuous', NI-DAQmx uses this value to determine the
    buffer size. This parameter is ignored for output tasks.If 'samplesPerChannel' is 1, one
    single value is read or written by asoftware trigger only. The parameters
    'samplingRate', 'bufferSize', 'sampleClockSource' and 'sampleClockRisingEdge' are
    ignored then.
**samplingRate**: {float}
    The sampling rate in samples per second per channel. If you use an external source for
    the Sample Clock, set this value to the maximum expected rate of that clock.
**setValWaitForFinish**: {int}
    If 1, the **setVal** call will block until all data has been written (only valid for finite
    tasks). If 0, setVal will return immediately, then use 'taskStarted' to verify if the
    operation has been finished.
**startTriggerLevel**: {float}
    Only for 'startTriggerMode' == 'analogEdge': The threshold at which to start acquiring
    or generating samples. Specify this value in the units of the measurement or generation.
**startTriggerMode**: {str}
    Specifies the start trigger mode. 'off': software-based start trigger, 'digitalEdge':
    The start of acquiring or generating samples is given if the 'startTriggerSource' is
    activated (based on 'startTriggerRisingEdge'), 'analogEdge': similar to 'digitalEdge',
    but the analog input 'startTriggerSource' has to pass the value 'startTriggerLevel'.
**startTriggerRisingEdge**: {int}
    Specifies on which slope of the signal to start acquiring or generating samples. 1:
    rising edge (default), 0: falling edge.
**startTriggerSource**: {str}
    The source terminal of the trigger source (if 'startTriggerMode' is set to 'digitalEdge'
    or 'analogEdge').
**supportedChannels**: {str}, read-only
    comma-separated list of all detected and supported channels with respect to the task
    type. Every item consists of the device name / channel name
**taskConfigured**: {int}, read-only
    Indicates if the task is properly configured (1, all task related parameters where
    accepted) or not (0).
**taskMode**: {str}
    mode of the task recording / data generation: finite, continuous
**taskName**: {str}, read-only
    name of the NI task that is related to this instance
**taskStarted**: {int}, read-only
    Indicates if the task is currently running (1) or stopped / inactive (0).
**taskType**: {str}, read-only
    task type: analogInput, analogOutput, digitalInput, digitalOutput


Usage
======

Channels
---------

Every task can consist of one or multiple channels, that are given as semicolon-separated list in the
**channels** parameter. Please note, that a digital task can only consist of digital channels and analog tasks
only of analog channels. Read the parameter **supportedChannels** to get all available channel names for
your task.

Every channel item in the semicolon-separated list consists of a configuration string (see examples below),
whose exact meaning depend on the task mode and type. The configuration string is a comma-separated list of items.
The first item is always the physical name of the channel, that usually consists of the device name (e.g. Dev1),
followed by a slash and the port name (e.g. AI0). For digital tasks, the physical name can also consist of
the device name, the port name and the line name (divided by slashes) if one single line (pin) of a port should
be used only (e.g. Dev0/port0/line1). All possible physical names are listed in **supportedChannels**.

For analog input and output tasks, a certain minimum and maximum voltage must be given (as integer or floating point number).

Analog input tasks have an additional parameter **ConfigMode**, that defines the input terminal configuration
of the channel. Possible values are:

.. code-block::

    DAQmx_Val_Cfg_Default = 0,
    DAQmx_Val_Diff = 1,
    DAQmx_Val_RSE = 2,
    DAQmx_Val_NRSE = 3,
    DAQmx_Val_PseudoDiff = 4

The possible configuration strings for one channel are:

* **Analog input channel**: PhysicalName,ConfigMode,MinVoltage,MaxVoltage
* **Analog output channel**: PhysicalName,MinVoltage,MaxVoltage
* **Digital input channel**: PhysicalName
* **Digital output channel**: PhysicalName

Data Types
-----------

Analog input or output tasks are always based on 2-dimensional dataObjects of dtype **float64**.
The rows corresponds to the channels in the active task and the columns correspond to the acquired samples.

Digital input or output tasks are always based on 2-dimensional dataObjects of dtypes **uint8**, **uint16** or
**int32**. The type **int32** is internally casted to **uint32** (however uint32 is not officially supported for
dataObjects). The correct bitdepth depend on whether a channel is assigned to a single line or an entire port.
In the first case, the datatype is usually **uint8**, in the latter case, the bitdepth depend on the number of
lines, that are covered by the port. If the wrong datatype is used, an appropriate error message will appear,
that indicates the desired bitdepth.

General
--------

The general approach to use a NI I/O device can be seen in one of the examples below. In general, it is
recommended to configure a plugin instance as far as possible. Then the task will be created and configured using
the **startDevice** command. In case of invalid parameters, **startDevice** will raise an exception, whose
error message usually gives detailed information about an invalid parameterization and possible different solutions.

The task can finally be deleted using **stopDevice**.

Input tasks will always be started using **acquire**. If a start trigger is given, the real acquisition will
be started if the trigger event is signalled (but after having called **acquire**). Finite tasks will automatically be
stopped if the requested number of samples per channel (**samplesPerChannel**) are acquired (if no reference
trigger is given). The values can then be obtained via **getVal** or **copyVal** (like for any other grabber or
dataIO device).

The acquisition of **continuous** tasks is also started by **acquire** (and an optional start trigger). Then all
data is temporarily stored into an internal buffer of the NI driver. The buffer size is usually automatically
determined based on **samplesPerChannel** (as far as this value is big enough, else NI determines its own internal
buffer size; see also the parameter **bufferSize**). As far as no fast TDMS logging is enabled, you have to
continuously receive the latest data via **getVal** or **copyVal** in order to avoid that the internal buffer
overflows. The continuous task is then stopped via **stop**.

For output tasks, a **MxN** data object must be passed to **setVal**, where **M** must correspond to the number
of channels in the task. **N** are the number of samples. However **N** is **not** the number that defines the
number of transmitted samples per channel. This is again defined by the parameter **samplesPerChannel**. If
**samplesPerChannel** is smaller than **N**, only the **samplesPerChannel** columns are written to the output
channels (using the sampling rate or sample clock). If **samplesPerChannel** is bigger than **N**, the write
operation restarts at the first column once the last column of the dataObject has been written.

For **finite output tasks**, it is possible to block the call of **setVal** until all samples have been
written by setting **setValWaitForFinish** to 1. Else **setVal** will return immediately. The end of the task
can then be continuously checked by getting the parameter **taskStarted** and check if it drops to 0 again.

Continuous output tasks will continuously write the columns and restart from the beginning until the task
will be stopped via **stop**.

Reference Trigger
------------------

The reference trigger can be configured in order to stop a task upon a certain trigger signal. This
reference trigger can only be applied to finite input tasks. Although the parameter **refTriggerMode** can
only be set to something else than **off** for finite input tasks, such a task will then behave like a continuous
input task. That means, that the task will be started via **acquire** and data will be continuously recorded
until the stop trigger condition is fulfilled (or the internal buffer overflows). To avoid the latter, it is
again necessary to continuously get intermediate data via **getVal** / **copyVal** or enable a fast TDMS logging.

The reference trigger listens to either a falling or raising edge of a digital line, or when an analog trigger
input jumps over (or below) a certain threshold value. However the task is only stopped if three different conditions
are met:

1. The trigger must be signalled (see **refTriggerSource**, **refTriggerMode**, **refTriggerRisingEdge** and **refTriggerLevel**)
2. A certain number of samples per channel must have been recorded (see **refTriggerPreTriggerSamples**)
3. If cond 1 and 2 are met, a certain number of post trigger samples will be recorded before stopping the task.
   This number is defined by **samplesPerChannel** - **refTriggerPreTriggerSamples**.


TDMS Logging
=============

NI provides a possibility to record all acquired values from all **input tasks** in the NI file format **TDMS**
(see https://www.ni.com/en-US/support/documentation/supplemental/07/tdms-file-format-internal-structure.html).

The filename of the tdms file, that should be used for the upcoming logging can be set by the parameter
**loggingFilePath**. The TDMS file format can contain multiple arrays from different recordings. Each array
is a two dimensional array, where each row belongs to one channel and the columns are the recorded samples.
Each array is stored under a certain path, where each node of the path is denoted as group.
Separate the different group names by a single slash, to provide a full path. The group name of the upcoming
recording is set via **loggingGroupName**. If the group name already exists in the tdms file, a suffix **#1**, **#2**, ...
is added to the leaf group name.
There are different options how to open or create a **TDMS** file. These can be set via **loggingOperation**.
It is for instance possible to always create a new file, to append data to an existing file among others.

The logging itself must be enabled by the parameter **loggingMode**. Set this value to 0 in order to disable logging.
Set it to 1 in order to enable a fast logging. Then all data is automatically logged into the TDMS file after
having called **acquire**, but it is not possible to simultaneously get the recorded data via **getVal** or **copyVal**.
The recording is done via background thread in the NI driver. The last possible value is 2. Then the task is
started like an ordinary task and whenever data is received via **getVal** or **copyVal**, the same data is
stored into TDMS file, too. No data is recorded if **getVal** or **copyVal** are not called.

It is recommended to set all logging parameters before calling **startDevice**. If one of these parameters
is changed later, the device is internally stopped, then the parameters are changed and the device is
reconfigured with the new logging properties.

If the logging is activated, the parameter **loggingActive** will be set to the currently active **loggingMode**.

See the example **demo_ai_tdms_logging.py** for a demo about the TDMS logging.

A TDMS file can for instance be read via the Python package **npTDMS** (https://pypi.org/project/npTDMS):

.. code-block:: python

    # coding=utf8

    """Demo to load and read a TDMS file

    Here, we read the TMDS files, that have been created
    by the ai_continuous and di_continuous demo scripts.

    This script requires the Python package npTDMS
    (https://pypi.org/project/npTDMS).
    """

    import nptdms as tdms
    import numpy as np

    # step 1: read the file demo_ai_continuous.tdms

    file = tdms.TdmsFile(r"D:\temp\demo_ai_continuous.tdms")

    print("Available groups:")
    print(file.groups())

    # access group object
    groupObject= file.object(file.groups()[0])


    data = []

    for obj in file.group_channels('group1'):
        data.append(obj.data)

    total2= np.vstack(data)
    plot1(total2)

Configuration Dialog and Toolbox
==================================

The plugin provides both a configuration dialog as well as a toolbox.

The toolbox comes with an overview panel, that shows some basic information about connected channels
and about the current run state of the task. In a 2nd tab, a general list of all parameters is displayed
by means of a generic parameter widget.

The configuration dialog let you configure all channels as well as provide access to all major
parameters, separated into different groups (like start trigger, reference trigger, sample clock etc.).

Compilation
============

To compile this plugin, make sure that the **ANSI C Support** of the NI-DAQmx driver
has been installed, too (see *driver* section above).

Then enable the option **PLUGIN_niDAQmx** in the CMake configuration of the plugins repository.
If the NI-DAQmx driver has been installed to default directories, CMake should automatically
detect the include and library path of the NI-DAQmx driver. Else, try to set

**NIDAQMX_DIR** to the main directory of the NI-DAQ driver (e.g. the directory, that contains
the *include* folder with the *NIDAQmx.h* file. Alternatively directly set the following
variables:

**NIDAQMX_INCLUDE_DIR** must point to the include directory of the NI-DAQmx driver. This is
the directory, that contains the file **NIDAQmx.h** and **NIDAQMX_LIBRARY** must point to the
linkable library of NIDAQmx, e.g. **NIDAQmx.lib** under Windows.

Examples
=========

All these examples can also be found in the **demo** folder of the **niDAQmx** plugin sources:

    Demo script for acquiring a finite (but unknown) number of analog
    values with a National Instruments DAQ device, where both the start

    To test this script, the NI MAX (Measurement & Automation
    Explorer) has been used to create simulated devices.

    In this test, a simulated device NI PCIe-6321 with 16 analog input (AI)
    ports was created and named "Dev1".

    The start trigger can watch a raising or falling edge of an analog
    or digital signal. If an analog signal is chosen, a certain threshold
    value has to be given, too (see parameter 'startTriggerLevel').

    The stop trigger is given by a so called reference trigger. This
    can only be enabled for finite, input tasks. However, such a trigger
    will implicitly let the finite task behave like a continuous task.
    This means, that you have to continuously retrieve the newest data using
    'getVal' or 'copyVal' such that the internal buffer does not overflow.
    The stop event for the task is defined by three conditions, that have
    to be met: At first, a certain number of samples (refTriggerPreTriggerSamples)
    have to be acquired, before the raising or falling edge of the given
    refTriggerSource is monitored. Then, this source must have the requested
    signal change. Once, this change is detected, the task will record further
    samples, whose number is called postTriggerSamples. They are calculated by
    "samplesPerChannel" - "refTriggerPreTriggerSamples". Then, the task is
    stopped and the parameter "taskStarted" becomes 0.

    Hint: It depends on the NI DAQ devices, if they allow
    integrating different devices into the same measurement
    task or not. Many devices do not allow this.

    Hint: The reference trigger could only be tested by the developer
    by a simulated NI device. This immediately fires the refTriggerSources, such
    that a 100% testing could not be executed.

    """Finite analog output task.

    Demo script for sending a series of number to different
    channels of a National Instruments DAQ device.

    To test this script, the NI MAX (Measurement & Automation
    Explorer) has been used to create simulated devices.

    In this test, a simulated device NI PCIe-6323 with 4 analog output (AO)
    ports was created and named "Dev4".

    Values are always written by a float64 dataObject, that is passed
    as argument to the 'setVal' method. This dataObject must be 2 dimensional
    and the number of rows must be equal to the number of channels.

    The number of samples that is written to each channel for each setVal
    command is mainly determined by the 'samplesPerChannel' argument.

    There are two cases to handle:

    1. If the dataObject has one column OR 'samplesPerChannel' is equal
       to 1, an unbuffered, single write operation is executed. This
       operation does not allow a hardware based start trigger.

    2. If the dataObject has more than one column, a buffered write
       operation is executed and any start trigger source is possible).
       If 'samplesPerChannel' is <= number of columns, the first columns
       will be send, until 'samplesPerChannel' samples have been sent to
       each channel. If its value is bigger than the number of columns,
       the dataObject will be repeated until the desired number of samples
       have been sent.

    """Continuous digital output task.

    Demo script for sending a series of number to different
    channels of a National Instruments DAQ device.

    To test this script, the NI MAX (Measurement & Automation
    Explorer) has been used to create simulated devices.

    In this test, a simulated device NI PCIe-6323 (Dev4) with 1 digital output
    port (DO) with 32 lines (buffered) and two other ports (port 1 and port 2), that
    support only unbuffered outputs.

    Values are always written by a uint8, uint16 or int32 dataObject, that is passed
    as argument to the 'setVal' method. This dataObject must be 2-dimensional
    and the number of rows must be equal to the number of channels. The int32
    object is internally casted to uint32 (however int32 is no valid dataObject
    data type). The datatype itself depends on the number of lines of each
    selected port. If the port has 0-8 lines, uint8 is required, for 9-16 lines
    uint16, else int32.

    The number of samples that is written to each channel for each setVal
    command is mainly determined by the 'samplesPerChannel' argument.

    There are two cases to handle:

    1. If the dataObject has one column OR 'samplesPerChannel' is equal
       to 1, an unbuffered, single write operation is executed. This
       operation does not allow a hardware based start trigger.

    2. If the dataObject has more than one column, a buffered write
       operation is executed and any start trigger source is possible).
       If 'samplesPerChannel' is <= number of columns, the first columns
       will be send, until 'samplesPerChannel' samples have been sent to
       each channel. If its value is bigger than the number of columns,
       the dataObject will be repeated until the desired number of samples
       have been sent.

Known Issues
============

- Counter tasks are not implemented yet.
- The development has only been tested based on simulated NI I/O devices. Therefore hardware-based start
  and reference triggers, as well as clock sources could not fully be tested, since they are all
  emulated as software triggers.
