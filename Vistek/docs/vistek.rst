**cameraIP**: {str}, read-only
    IP address of the camera

    bit-depth for camera buffer
**timestamp**: {float}, read-only
    Time in ms since last image (end of exposure)
**streamingPacketSize**: {int}, read-only
    Used streaming packet size (in bytes, more than 1500 usually only possible if you enable jumbo-frames at your network adapter)
**logLevel**: {int}
    Log level. The logfile is Vistek_SVGigE.log in the current directory. 0 - logging off (default),  1 - CRITICAL errors that prevent from further operation, 2 - ERRORs that prevent from proper functioning, 3 - WARNINGs which usually do not affect proper work, 4 - INFO for listing camera communication (default), 5 - DIAGNOSTICS for investigating image callbacks, 6 - DEBUG for receiving multiple parameters for image callbacks, 7 - DETAIL for receiving multiple signals for each image callback
