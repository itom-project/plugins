This fit can be executed by different fit strategies: 
- leastSquareFit minimizes the sum of  the squared distances of all valid points to the plane (direct solution)
- leastSquareFitSVD does the same using a svd algorithm 
- leastMedianFit minimizes the median of the absolute distances of all valid points to the plane

        <source>This method fits a two-dimensional polynomial of given order in x- and y-direction to the data &apos;inputData&apos;. 

For the fit, the optional scale and offset values of the input data object are considered. The fit is executed in double precision, such that the input is converted to float64 (if not yet done). NaN values in the input data object are ignored. Optionally, you can give a weighting data object (needs to have the same dimension and size than inputData) such that the values are weighted with the values of the data object &apos;weights&apos;. Values with corresponding weights &lt;= 0 are ignored as well. 

Depending on the orders, the fitted polynomial, whose coefficients are returned by this filter, has the following form: 

    if (orderX &lt;= orderY): 
    
        .. math:: f(x,y) = \sum_{i=0}^{orderX} \sum_{j=0}^{orderY-i} p_{ij} x^i y^j 
    else: 
    
        .. math:: f(x,y) = \sum_{j=0}^{orderY} \sum_{i=0}^{orderX-i} p_{ij} x^i y^j 

The coefficients p_ij are stored in the coefficients vector in the order they appear in the equation above. 

The solver uses a Vandermonde matrix V as solving strategy and tries to solve V*p=Z, where Z are the valid values of the input data object. The overdetermined system of linear equations is finally solved using a QR factorization of V. If this module is compiled with LAPACK, its solvers are used, else the solve-command of OpenCV (slower) is called. In order to speed up the calculation you can use the parameter &apos;reduceFactor&apos;. If it is set to any value &gt;= 1, The input plane is divided into a grid of (orderY+1)*reduceFactor x (orderX+1)*reduceFactor rectangles. In every rectangle an arbitrary valid value is selected and used for the determination only. If no valid value could be found after a certain number of new random values, no value is taken from this rectangle. The algorithm returns an error if less values could have been selected than are needed for the fit of given orders. 

The definition of the polynomial function is slightly different than the one used in the similar fitting function &apos;fitPolynom2D&apos;.</source>

        <source>One-dimensional polynomial fit in z-direction for a 3D - data object. 

The input data object must be three-dimensional and is internally casted to float64 (if not yet done). The resulting polynomial parameters per pixel are stored in the output data object &apos;polynoms&apos; whose z-dimension is equal to (order+2). The first (order+1) planes contain the coefficients p0...pn and the last plane contain the pixel wise residual error. 

The polynomial is y(x) = p0 + x*p1 ... + x^n*pn 
The residual is the sum of the quadratical errors from each valid pixel to the fitted polynomial. 

If no &apos;xVals&apos; are assigned, the x-values for each plane are calculated using the offset and scale of the data-object in z-direction, such that an equally spaced vector of (0,1,2,3...) is the default. 

You can additionally give a weight data object (same dimension than &apos;data&apos;) for weighting the values. NaN values in &apos;data&apos; and weights &lt;= 0 are ignored. If a fit cannot be done due to too less or degenerated values, NaN is returned in &apos;polynoms&apos; at this pixel. 

For a first order fit, a direct least squares solution is used which is very fast, for the other orders a system of linear equations is solved (using a SVD decomposition) which can be slower. On a multi-core processor you can assign a number of threads that are used to parallelly compute the approximations for each pixel.</source>

This filter operates inplace and subtracts from fitted one-dimensional polynoms from the values in the given 2D data object &apos;data&apos;. The polynoms are either fitted along the 
vertical or horizontal axis. You can choose a polynomial order between 1 (line) and 7. The values are uniformly weighted for the fit. The algorithm uses a fast, direct solution

        <source>returns the linearly interpolated values of a given input dataObject at specific 2D point coordinates. 

The given input data object must be a real valued object with two dimensions or a region of interest that only contains one plane (e.g. 1xMxN). 
The point coordinates (coordsSubPix) is a Nx2 floating point data object where each row is the row and column coordinate (sub-pixel) of the desired value. The values must be given 
in the coordinates of the data object (scale values).
The resulting interpolated values are returned as &apos;values&apos; list. The input data object is allowed to contain non-finite values. 

For the interpolation a search rectangle whose height and width is given by &apos;searchRect&apos; is centered at the rounded coordinate and a plane is robustly fitted into the valid 
values that lie within the rectangle. The value is then determined using the coefficients of the fitted plane. Infinite values are ignored for the determination of the plane. 
The plane is calculated by least-squares fit. If the rectangle exceeds the boundaries of the given matrix, it moved inside of the matrix such that the searched coordinate still lies within 
the rectangle. If this is not possible, NaN is returned as value.</source>

This filter processes independently every plane of the input object. For every plane the following steps are done: 

1. Locate connected areas with NaN values (using OpenCVs method &apos;connectedComponentsWithStats&apos;). 
2. For every area whose size does not exceed &apos;maxAreaSize&apos;: 
   
   - depending on &apos;regionType&apos; and &apos;regionExtend&apos; an enlarged area around the NaN area is taken 
   - depending on &apos;method&apos; an interpolation plane or single value is calculated using all valid values within the enlarged area 
   - The NaN values within the area are filled with the interpolated plane value of the interpolated scalar 

**RegionType** 

* Per default, the region type is &apos;BoundingBox&apos;. Then, a rectangular bounding box is set around each area of invalid values and the size of the bounding box. 
  is increased in all directions by the parameter &apos;regionExtend&apos; (different value possible for horizontal and vertical extend). &apos;BoundingBox&apos; is the fastest
  method, however may produce very varying results, if the shape of the areas is different from simple rectangles. 
* ErodeRect: Around the invalid area, an erosion is calculated with a rectangle element. The interpolation is only done with values within the eroded ribbon. 
  The extend is the maximum horizontal and vertical distance from a edge element of the invalid area, e.g. (1,1) is a 1-pixel ribbon whose valid values are used for interpolation. 
* ErodeEllipse: This is the same than &apos;ErodeRect&apos;, however the element has an ellipse form and not a rectangle making the ribbon more smooth. 

**Method** 

* LeastSquaresPlane: A plane is fitted into the valid values of the region using the least squares fit approach. 
* LMedSPlane: A plane is fitted into the valid values of the region using the approach to minimize the median of the squared distances. 
* Mean: A mean value of a valid values of the region replaces the invalid values within the region. 
* Median: A median value of a valid values of the region replaces the invalid values within the region. 

Currently, the filter does not work inplace such that the output object is always a newly allocated dataObject of the same type and size than the input object.</source>

        <source>Fit a polynomial p(x,y) of order (orderX, orderY) in x- and y-direction. 

The fit function always looks like this: 

f(x,y) = sum_{m=0}^{M} sum_{n=0}^{N} ( p_nm * x^n * y^m ) 

This definition is slightly different from the polynomial fitted by the similar function &apos;polyfitWeighted2d&apos;. 

Puts the fitted points into the data object &apos;fittedImage&apos;. This method does not weight the input values and does not 
return the coefficients for the polynomial. Use polyfitWeighted2d if you want to have an enhanced fit.</source>
